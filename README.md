# Visualizing state wise substance use and its correlation with other factors

In this project, I try to find a correlation if any exists between the intake of drugs and other factors like mental health, crime rate, and suicide rates. I make use of statistical graphs, correlation plots, overlayed static maps and interactive folium maps in this analysis.

Jupyter Report: map_ps0.ipynb [Opening in google colab is recommended for interactive maps]
